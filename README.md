### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicholas Abell, and I'm on a mission to turn my passion for coding into a thriving career. Welcome to my coding journey!

#### About Me

I'm an entry-level self-taught developer with a flair for creativity and a fascination for technology. I started my coding journey by diving into C# and creating video games that sparked my imagination. Using Unity, I crafted my first appâ€”a score calculator for the board game Everdell, designed especially for my family's enjoyment.

But my journey didn't stop there. I transitioned to the world of front-end development with an unwavering goal: to transform my passion into a profession. The world of web development quickly became my playground, where I'm always on the lookout for new tools, techniques, and design trends.
