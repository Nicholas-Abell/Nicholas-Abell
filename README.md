### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicholas Abell.
https://nicholas-abell-mr5i.vercel.app/

I started my coding journey learning C# to make video games.
Using Unity i made my first app, a score calculator for the board game Everdell that I made for my family.
From there i switched to learning front end development in hopes of turning my passion into a career. 
I'm currently focusing on improving my backend skills.
